# Prework Website

## Description
This webpage was made as a part of an edX coding bootcamp. It was done as a first step to learning how to code in a professional manner. The webpage provides some details in the usage of CSS, HTML, GitHub, and JavaScript; all of which I learned a great deal about these in the process of constructing it.
