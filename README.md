# Prework-Journal
Logging things learned during prework

## Monday, 9th September 2024
Today I went through what it takes to make a developer's mindset. Things like setting aside a quarter hour each week to check in with current trends among the developer community. I also skimmed over an HTML cheatsheet that contains much more in depth coding references than I've used in the past: C:\Users\Robert Jones\Documents\Coding<br>
Additionally, I learned the process used to build a solution to a problem in code is to:<br><br> 
Decompose it - Individualise the parts of the problem<br>
Recognize a pattern<br>
Abstract the problem - Focus on relevant parts<br>
Test and debug the solution<br>
Lastly, reviewed ways of making the environment Agile; which is to say welcoming and adaptive to needs and changes.<br>
**Ended on 2.1.7**<br><br>
## Tuesday, 10th September 2024
I swapped over to using Google Chrome for the class, installed Screencastify, and signed up for Slack. Also installed Git Bash for command line execution.<br>
pwd is print working directory, showhing which directory we're in<br>
"cd downloads" is change directory | "cd .." moves up one directory<br>
"ls" will show the files in that directory<br>
"mkdir FILENAME" makes a directory, or folder<br>
"touch FILENAME.FILEEXTENTION" makes a file<br>
"start FILENAME.FILEEXTENTION" opens the file<br>
Set up an SSH ket to GITHUB for both laptop and desktop computers.<br>
"ssh-add ~/.ssh/FILENAME" - Make it w/Password<br>
Copy it, put it in GitHub's SSH keys<br>
"ssh -T git@github.com" to test it<br>
**Ended on 2.3.1**<br><br>
## Saturday, 14th September 2024
I went over version control and how it could help understand and avoid bugs that may make code unusable.<br>
"git revert #######" Will use the first 7 letters/numbers of a version code, or SHA, to revert to the given version<br>
Learned how to navigate GitHub, check and make repositories, make forks, create pull requests, and merge branches.<br>
**Ended on 2.3.8**<br><br>
## Monday, 16th September 2024
Copied a repo from GitHub onto my local files.<br>
Using "git clone "SSH VALUE" once in the local directory you want it copied to.<br>
"code ." will open the file in the CMD into VS Code<br>
To create a new branch you need to:
"git" will precede every statement to work in GitHub<br>
"checkout" moves the working branch to the new one<br>
"-b" creates a new branch<br>
"feature/NAMEOFBRANCH" indicates it's a feature branch<br>
Together, the code should be "git checkout -b feature/NAMEOFBRANCH"<br>
"git status" checks to see the status of changed or untracked files that differentiate from the local directory and GitHub<br>
"git add -A" will add the modification in the current working branch to the staging area. "-A" indicates that we want to add all changes.<br>
"git pull origin main" will recieve main or a branch's modifications into the local working area.<br>
"git push origin BRANCH/NAMEOFBRANCH" will push the branch to GitHub in order for you to share or create a pull request.<br>
**Ended on 2.4.6** Which will need to be reviewed. <br><br>
## Wednesday, 18th September 2024
Refreshed myself about elements in HTML<br>
Learned the difference between header and body.<br>
Set up the beginning of the Prework study guide and it's HTML framework to be turned in at the end of the prework.<br>
**Ended on 3.1.7**<br><br>
## Friday, 20th September 2024
Learned how to connect an external CSS reference sheet with the working HTML document.<br>
Was introduced to many of the elements of CSS code and how it works to set up style on the HTML document.<br>
Learned how to designate sections and tie them with having specific styling using . and a reference word.<br>
**Ended on 3.2.7**<br><br>
