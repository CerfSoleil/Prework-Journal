        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p2>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is used to structure the content of a page.</p2>
        <h3>The Head Element</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element of HTML will detail things that allow the document to be read as HTML and set up for future elements and code seen later.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Body Element</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>This is currently in he body element of the document.</li>
          <li>The body element is what you will see in the document when loaded as a web page. It is the only thing the end user should see.</li>
          <li>HTML uses code such as &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs, &lt;ul&gt; for dotted lists, and &lt;br&gt; for line breaks.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p2>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, allows you to structure HTML on a page visually.</p2>
        <ul>
          <li>Elements can be made to have the same rules using a comma between selectors, such as "header, footer &#123;&#125;" with the defining style within the brackets.</li>
          <li>Linking your style sheet to the HTML page requires a reference in the HTML</li>
          <li>This reference may be set up within the head of the code as "&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href=".RELATIVE/LOCATION.css"&gt;"</li>
          <li>Rules can be applied to specific HTML elements on the CSS code using class selectors where ".REFERENCE" will have the period define the following word as a designation.</li>
          <li>This then must be added to the HTML sheet in the section designation.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <p2>GitHub is a very useful tool for sharing your code and using version control to keep track of changes and updates!</p2>
        <ul>
          <li>It allows you to store, share, and work together with others on code.</li>
          <li>This can be done both in a private, or public environment!</li><br>
        </ul>
        <p2>This is how you can create a branch to work with your local files and push the update to Git Hub.</p2>
        <ol>
          <li>"ssh -T git@github.com" will establish and test your connection to GitHub</li>
          <li>"git status" will check what branch you are currently on as well as list untracked changes or additions to the files.</li>
          <li>"git checkout -b BRANCH/NAME" will create a new branch and switch to it.</li>
          <li>"git add -A" will add the modification in the current working branch to the staging area. "-A" indicates that we want to add all changes.</li>
          <li>"git pull origin main" will recieve main or a branch's modifications into the local working area.</li>
          <li>"git push origin BRANCH/NAME" will push the branch to GitHub in order for you to share or create a pull request.</li>
          <li>"git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE" will update the repository with your local changes.</li>
          <li>The Pull Request must then be handled on GitHub.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p2>JavaScript allows the code that you're working with to be interacted with.</p2>
        <ul>
          <li>This can be anywhere from visual effects, to data communication, to games.</li>
          <li>JavaScript allows a page to do more than convey static information!</li><br>
        </ul>
        <p2>The following are some of the ways that JavaScript works.</p2>
        <ul>
          <li>It utilizes a default Control Flow. Control Flow is the order that the computer executes code. By default, it starts top and executes going down.</li>
          <li>It can be used to create statements that give a variable dependent on an input using if/else statements.</li>
